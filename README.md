# Intro to Cryptography

This is a collection of programs that demonstrate basics of cryptography. At the moment, this program supports Atbash, Caeser, Affine and Vignere ciphers, frequency analysis of strings, BASE16, BASE32, BASE64 and ASCII85 encoding and decoding, BASE64 encoding and decoding files, converting base-10 integers to base-n numbers and vice versa, converting strings to Morse code and vice versa and hashing files and strings into MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3-256 and SHA3-512.

## Disclaimer:

This is a work in progress. The main program is almost final, but I don't know, there may yet be problems. There may be bugs in the modules.
